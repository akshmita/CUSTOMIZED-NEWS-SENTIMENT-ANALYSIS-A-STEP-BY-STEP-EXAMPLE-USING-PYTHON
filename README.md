CUSTOMIZED NEWS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS: A STEP-BY-STEP EXAMPLE USING PYTHON
In this article, I will take you through a step-by-step process of building a foreboding index using a customized dictionary with python tools. The customized dictionary has 102 positive words representing foreboding, anxiousness, or uncertainty and 102 negative words representing antonyms of foreboding, anxiousness or uncertainty. The methodology for creating the dictionary is found in Roy Trivedi (2021). For TFI only the words "foreboding, uncertainty, fear, worry" were taken into account, which we will call as root words.
